# Client-Server Communication Discussion Questions

## Objectives

* Practice reading and reasoning about code
* Discuss events with out

## Exercise

Take a look at each of the code samples below. Each example will show you some code, as well as either the return value of what is logged to the console.

1. How does this piece of code work?
2. Why does the code do what it does?
3. Given this code sample, what can you learn or describe about JavaScript

### Example 1

```javascript
const url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p94q-8hxh" // CityBike Data from data.gov
const data = fetch(url)

console.log(data) // Promise {<pending>}
```

### Example 2

```javascript
const url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p94q-8hxh" // CityBike Data from data.gov
fetch(url).then(console.log)
// Response {type: "cors", url: "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p94q-8hxh", redirected: false, status: 200, ok: true, …}
```

### Example 3

```javascript
const url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p94q-8hxh" // CityBike Data from data.gov
fetch(url)
  .then(function(response){
    return response.json()
  }).then(console.log)
// {id: "p94q-8hxh", name: "Citi Bike Live Station Feed (JSON)", attribution: "CitiBike", attributionLink: "http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json", averageRating: 0, …}```
```

### Bonus

How would you implement a function called `getJSON` so that the below code works as outlined?

```javascript
const url = "https://data.cityofnewyork.us/api/views/p94q-8hxh" // CityBike Data from data.gov

getJSON(url).then(console.log)
// {id: "p94q-8hxh", name: "Citi Bike Live Station Feed (JSON)", attribution: "CitiBike", attributionLink: "http://citibikenyc.com/stations/json", averageRating: 0, …}``
```
